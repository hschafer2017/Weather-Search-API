queue()
.defer(d3.json, "API NAME")
.await(makeCharts) 

this can be done with a CSV using an external source also 

<form id = "city" onSubmit = "newCity(); return false;">
            <input type="text" name="city" id = "city" placeholder="City" required/>
            
        </form>
        <button type="submit" onClick= "newCity()" class="btn btn-secondary center-block">Search</button>
        
by using the "onSubmit" in the form, this allows you to hit enter instead of hitting the search button without having the page refresh 
make sure to add return false at the end of the JS function that you're calling in the button
